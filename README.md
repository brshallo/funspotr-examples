# funspotr-examples

This repository contains examples of using the package
[funspotr](https://github.com/brshallo/funspotr) on a few github
repositories. See “R/save-examples.R” for the code used to write files
to “data” folder.

Currently the data files are static .rds files. However in the future
I’d like to use github actions to (potentially) make some of the data
files located here update on a regular basis.

## Current .rds files

``` r
fs::dir_ls("data")
#> data/brshallo-blog-20220114.rds      data/drob-tidy-tuesdays-20220114.rds 
#> data/jsilge-blog-20220114.rds        data/r4ds-chapter-files-20220117.rds
```
