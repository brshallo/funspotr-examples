# funspotr-examples

This repository contains examples of using the package [funspotr](https://github.com/brshallo/funspotr) on a few github repositories. See "R/save-examples.R" for the code used to write files to "data" folder.

Currently the data files are static .rds files. However in the future I'd like to use github actions to (potentially) make some of the data files located here update on a regular basis.

## Current .rds files

```{r}
fs::dir_ls("data")
```
